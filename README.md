## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Problem:** Predict whether a New York City Airbnb listing is instantly bookable.
- **Approach:** Binary classification using scikit-learn.
- **Dataset:** NYC Airbnb Open Data (modified version provided in course).

This project involved independently following the full machine learning life cycle—from problem formulation to model improvement.

## 🔄 ML Life Cycle Stages

- ✅ **Problem Definition** – Framed "instant bookability" as a binary classification task.  
- ✅ **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Loaded raw Airbnb listing data and cleaned relevant fields.  
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized feature distributions and correlations.  
- ✅ **Feature Engineering** – Selected relevant features and encoded categorical variables.  
- ✅ **Model Training** – Trained classification models using logistic regression.  
- ✅ **Model Evaluation** – Used accuracy, precision, recall, and PR curves to evaluate performance.  
- ✅ **Model Improvement** – Tuned model hyperparameters and refined input features.
